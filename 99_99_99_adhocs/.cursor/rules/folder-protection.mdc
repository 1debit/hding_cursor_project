# Folder Protection Protocol

## CRITICAL: Essential Folder Protection

**NEVER DELETE OR MODIFY THESE CORE FOLDERS WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION:**

### Protected Folders
- `global/` - Contains all global resources, knowledge base, and shared utilities
  - `global/knowledge_base/` - Business domain knowledge, table structures, query patterns
  - `global/shared/` - Cross-project utilities and scripts
- `projects/` - Contains all project work and analysis
- `.cursor/` - Contains AI assistant rules and configurations
- `cloned/` - Contains cloned repositories for reference

### Protection Protocol
**Before ANY operation that might affect these folders:**
1. **Ask explicit permission** from user
2. **Create backup** if operation is risky
3. **Use non-destructive methods** when possible
4. **Test on small scope** before applying broadly

### Knowledge Base is SACRED
- Contains months of accumulated business knowledge
- Cannot be easily recreated without user teaching
- Always preserve existing content
- Only add new information, never replace wholesale

### File Operations Safety
- **NEVER use `git reset --hard`** without explicit user permission
- **ALWAYS backup important files** before any destructive operations
- **Ask user before any git reset operations** - even if trying to fix push issues
- **Use `git reset --soft` or `git checkout`** instead of hard resets when possible
- **If files are lost, immediately check `git reflog`** to find recovery commit

### User's Data is PRECIOUS
- Treat every file as irreplaceable until confirmed otherwise
- When in doubt, ask permission
- Preserve existing work and knowledge
