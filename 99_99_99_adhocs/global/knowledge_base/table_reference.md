## üîó Table Relationships

### Core Relationship Patterns

#### Transaction to Dispute Linking
```sql
-- Standard pattern for linking transactions to disputes
FROM risk.test.spending_risk_master_driver_table a
LEFT JOIN risk.prod.disputed_transactions b
  ON (a.user_id = b.user_id
      AND (b.authorization_code = a.auth_id
           OR b.authorization_code = a.settled_auth_id))
QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
  PARTITION BY a.user_id, a.auth_id
  ORDER BY b.dispute_created_at
) = 1
```

#### Dual Auth Pattern
```sql
-- Linking original auth to settlement
FROM edw_db.core.fct_realtime_auth_event rae
LEFT JOIN edw_db.core.fct_realtime_auth_event dual
  ON (rae.user_id = dual.user_id
      AND rae.auth_id = dual.original_auth_id)
```

#### Card Information Joining
```sql
-- Joining card details using PAN last 4 digits
LEFT JOIN edw_db.core.dim_card c
  ON (rae.user_id = c.user_id
      AND RIGHT(rae.pan, 4) = RIGHT(c.card_number, 4))
```

## üìã Usage Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
- **Efficient Filtering:** Use `response_cd IN ('00','10')` for successful auths, `req_amt < 0` for purchases
- **JOIN Strategies:** Use `QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER()` for deduplication, join cards via last 4 digits
- **Partitioning Strategy:** Leverage date-based partitioning for time-series analysis

### Data Quality
- **Common Pitfalls:**
  - Merchant names need `UPPER()` standardization
  - Dual auths require linking original to settlement
  - Dispute amounts are negative values
- **Validation Methods:**
  - Case studies to validate feature correctness
  - Cross-reference dispute rates with known patterns
  - Verify data freshness (< 1 day latency for prod tables)
