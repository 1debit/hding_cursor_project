# Miscellaneous Adhocs - Project Memory

## 📋 Project Overview

**Start Date:** 2025-09-11
**Status:** Active
**Purpose:** This project has no dedicated purpose. I will use this project folder for small projects or problems that don't warrant their own dedicated project. Documentation will be kept minimal and informal.

## 🔗 Knowledge Sources

For analysis and problem-solving, I will rely on:
- **Global knowledge base**: Established patterns, SQL templates, and technical solutions from previous projects
- **User-provided knowledge**: Temporary context and information fed during specific analysis sessions

## 📝 Session Notes

*Informal notes and findings will be added here as needed*

---

*Minimal documentation approach - focus on getting work done efficiently.*
