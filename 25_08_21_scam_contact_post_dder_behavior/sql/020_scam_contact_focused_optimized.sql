-- Title: Focused & Optimized Scam Contact Analysis (2025-01 to 2025-03)
-- Intent: Identify users who reported being scammed during focused period with optimized AI processing
-- Inputs: analytics.looker.zendesk_tickets_base, analytics.looker.zendesk_tickets_comments_raw
-- Output: RISK.TEST.hding_scam_contact_confirmed_victims table (user_id, earliest_scam_contact_date, earliest_contact_channel, confirmed_scam_contacts)
-- Assumptions: Zendesk tickets capture phone transcripts and chat conversations during Q1 2025
-- Validation: Reduced dataset size, optimized AI processing, robust execution for long-running queries

-- ======================================================================================
-- FOCUSED PERIOD: 2025-01-01 to 2025-03-31 (Q1 2025)
-- OPTIMIZATION: Combined contacts per user to minimize AI calls
-- ROBUSTNESS: Server-side execution, no client dependency

======================================================================================
EXECUTION NOTES FOR LAPTOP-INDEPENDENT RUNNING:
======================================================================================

âœ… QUERY DESIGNED FOR ROBUST EXECUTION:
1. Runs server-side in Snowflake (laptop can be closed after submission)
2. Query timeout set to 1 hour (should complete much faster with Q1 data)
3. All operations are database-native (no client dependencies)
4. Results written to persistent table (RISK.TEST.hding_scam_contact_confirmed_victims)

ðŸ“Š EXPECTED PERFORMANCE WITH Q1 2025 DATA:
- Date range: ~60% smaller than original (3 months vs 6 months)
- Expected records: ~50K-80K instead of 220K
- AI calls: ~20K-30K users instead of 170K
- Execution time: 10-20 minutes instead of hours
- Cost: ~$20-100 instead of $150-750

ðŸŽ¯ OPTIMIZATION BENEFITS:
- Combined approach: Fewer AI calls per user
- Focused period: Much smaller dataset
- Pre-filtering: Only meaningful content processed
- Robust execution: Server-side processing

ðŸ’¡ MONITORING PROGRESS:
After starting the query, you can close your laptop. Check progress later with:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM RISK.TEST.hding_scam_contact_confirmed_victims;

ðŸš€ READY TO EXECUTE!
